# Student Record Management System — Java (File Handling + Collections + Sorting)

## 📖 Overview
This project implements a **Student Record Management System** using Java.
It demonstrates storing and retrieving student records using **file handling**, displaying them using the **Collections Framework**, and sorting them using **Comparator**.

The program loads existing data from a text file at startup (`students.txt`) and saves updates back to the file upon exit.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
Based on Lab 4 guidelines:

✔ Load records from a file using **BufferedReader**  
✔ Save updates to a file using **BufferedWriter**  
✔ Store student records using **ArrayList**  
✔ Display data with an **Iterator**  
✔ Sort records using **Comparator (marks descending)**  
✔ Implement add, delete, search, view functionality
